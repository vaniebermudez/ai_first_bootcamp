      "\n",
      "1. **Life Insurance**: \n",
      "   - This type of insurance provides financial assistance to your family or beneficiaries in the event of your death or an accident. It ensures that they are financially supported during a difficult time. An example is the BPI-Philam Life Protect Insurance, which offers coverage starting at Php 320 per month.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Non-Life Insurance**: \n",
      "   - This category covers potential loss or damage to property rather than life. Examples include:\n",
      "     - **Fire Insurance**: Protects against losses from fire and can also cover damages from other events like theft, natural disasters (earthquakes, floods), and riots. It can apply to residential homes, commercial buildings, and their contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Pre-Need Plans**: \n",
      "   - These plans help individuals prepare for future expenses, such as education or funeral costs. Memorial plans are a common type of pre-need plan, where individuals pay in advance for funeral services, relieving their families of financial burdens during a difficult time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Variable Life Insurance**: \n",
      "   - This type of insurance combines life coverage with an investment component, allowing policyholders to grow their money while providing life insurance. An example is the BPLAC Invest Peso Max, which offers a combined investment and life insurance plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "These categories cover a range of needs, from protecting loved ones financially to safeguarding property and preparing for future expenses. Each type of insurance serves to mitigate risks and provide peace of mind in various aspects of life.\n"
